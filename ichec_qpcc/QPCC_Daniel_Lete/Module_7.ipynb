Extend your report to document your understanding of early and NISQ era quantum algorithms by addressing the following 5 topics:\n","\n","  - Are any early and/or NISQ era quantum algorithms relevant to your industry​.\n","  - Could you think of a use case where quantum algorithm​s are not relevant?\n","  - Could you think of a use case where you could test the application of a quantum algorithm​ immediately or in the near future. What performance metrics could you use to verify it's usefulness.\n","  - Could you think of a use case where you could apply a quantum algorithm​ in the less immediate future. What quantum software simulation resources or quantum hardware, that are currenlty not available, would you need. Do you have a rough idea how long it would take before the required scale is available?\n","  - Do you have a plan in place to follow the development of quantum algorithms and quantum hardware? What actions would you take once a desired level of maturity is reached?\n","\n","\n","\n","2. In this module we will use IBM Qiskit to code two simple quantum algorithms.
